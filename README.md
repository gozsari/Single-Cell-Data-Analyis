* A **tisuue** is a group of cells that have similar structure and function together as a unit. 
* **Transcription profiling:** Also known as **expression profiling**. It involves the quantification of gene expression of many genes in cells or tissue samples at the transcription (RNA) level.
* **Gene expression** is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of functional gene product that enables it to produce end products, protein or non-coding RNA, end ultimately phenotype, as final effect.
* **Tissue heterogeneity** refers to the fact that data generated with biological samples can be compromised by cells originating from other tissues or organs than the target tissue or organ of profiling. It can be caused by biological processes (such as immune cell infiltration), sample contamination, or mistakes in sample labelling.

## Notes
* Single-cell RNA-seq can asses the global state of all mRNA transcripts being expresses within a tissue with single-cell resolution, so with high content measures.
* Single-cell RNA-seq enables questions about tissue heterogeneity and how cells transition between different phsiological states.
